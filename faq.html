                After you sign up, we will match you to an available counselor who fits your objectives, preferences, and the type of issues you are dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of focus, so it's important to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. We have found that we are able to provide a successful match most of the time; however, if you start the process and you feel your counselor isn't a good fit for you, you may elect to be matched to a different counselor.

                Our team ensures that every provider we bring to the platform is fully licensed and in good standing. Providers who apply are required to provide proper licensure documentation, proof of identity, and references from other licensed practitioners who have worked with them. We then cross-check their licensure information with their respective state licensing board.
                <p>In addition to checking credentials, each potential provider needs to complete a case study exam by a licensed clinician and a be evaluated in a video interview. The result of this rigorous 4-5 week process is that only about 15% of the therapists who apply to work through BetterHelp are accepted to the platform.</p>
                <p>We also show the full licensing information for each provider to make it easy for you to do your own due diligence on your counselor.</p>

                The professionals who work through BetterHelp are licensed and credentialed therapists who were certified by their state's board to provide therapy and counseling. However, while the service may have similar benefits, it's not capable of substituting for traditional face-to-face therapy in every case. Please note that your provider won't be able to make any official diagnosis, to fulfill any court order or prescribe medication.

                Once you are matched to a counselor, you and your counselor will get a dedicated "room", which will be your private and secure place to communicate. In this room, you will write about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the issues that trouble you. Your counselor will then read your messages, and respond with questions, feedback, insights, and guidance.<br>
                <br>
                You can exchange messages with your counselor at any time, from anywhere, using any Internet-connected device. The room is open 24/7 and since messaging is not in real-time it doesn't require scheduling. Instead, you can choose whenever you want to write or respond to your counselor. You will get a notification by email when the counselor has sent you a message.

                <br>
                To talk with your counselor over the phone, you will need to schedule a time with your counselor and log in to your counseling room at that time. The counselor will prompt you to start the phone session and the system will ask you for your phone number. The system will then call you at that number and connect you with your counselor to start the phone session. Please note that the phone number you enter will not be shared with the counselor.

                Services offered using this site are generally not covered by health insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.<br>
                <br>
                Coverage and benefits for traditional therapy and counseling services change from one health insurance company to another and from plan to plan, but generally the following rules apply:
                <ul class="faqlist">
                  <li>With many health insurance plans, coverage can be partial or very limited.</li>
                  <li>Even if your plan covers all your costs, the co-pay that you would be required to contribute may be higher than the entire cost of BetterHelp.</li>
                  <li>In many cases, before you can get reimbursed by your insurance company, your therapist would have to diagnose you with a mental disorder or issue. This diagnosis would be sent to the insurance company and recorded in your medical file. In some cases the therapist would also have to provide additional clinical information to the insurance company, such as treatment plans, summaries or copies of the entire record.</li>
                </ul>If you consider using your health insurance, please check your coverage carefully by asking the following questions:
                <ul class="faqlist">
                  <li>Do I have mental health insurance benefits?</li>
                  <li>What is my deductible and has it been met?</li>
                  <li>How many sessions per year does my health insurance cover?</li>
                  <li>What is the coverage amount per therapy session?</li>
                  <li>Is approval required from my primary care physician?</li>
                </ul>Please note that BetterHelp offers very affordable pricing options which are typically comparable with the co-pays of most insurance plans.

                The service is provided by independent providers who work directly with you. These providers are not employees of BetterHelp and the site doesn't oversee them professionally. Our mission is to build, maintain, and support a platform that lets users and counselors communicate effectively, and to facilitate this channel so they can get the most out of their interaction.

                There are many studies that confirm the effectiveness of the online medium for making life changes. For example, a study published by JMIR Publications and conducted by researchers from University of California - Berkeley, University of California - San Francisco, and the San Francisco General Hospital, concluded that “users of BetterHelp experienced significantly reduced depression symptom severity after engaging with the platform.” You can read the full study <a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e10948/">here</a>.
                <p>Our confidence in the platform comes primarily from the <a href="../reviews/index.htm" target="_blank">feedback and testimonials</a> we receive from users. Every day we are excited to hear from more people about the way this service helped them make a tremendous change in their lives.</p>

                We are totally obsessed about securing your privacy and confidentiality. We have built a state-of-the-art technology, operation, and infrastructure with one thing in mind: protecting your privacy and safeguarding the information you provide. Our privacy and confidentiality standards are by far more advanced than what is required by law or regulations, so you can feel safe and comfortable.
                <ul class="faqlist">
                  <li>You don't need to identify yourself (see more about staying anonymous <a href="../privacy/index.htm">here</a>).
                  </li>
                  <li>Everything you tell your counselor is protected by strict federal and state laws.</li>
                  <li>We don't cooperate or work with any insurance companies or employers, so nothing needs to be shared, reported or filed with them.</li>
                  <li>You can always click the "Shred" button next to each message that you've sent so it will no longer show in your account.</li>
                  <li>All the messages between you and your counselor are secured and encrypted by banking-grade 256-bit encryption.</li>
                  <li>Our servers are hosted in an "A Grade" facility, ensuring the best-in-class security and protection.</li>
                  <li>Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices, providing world class online security and encryption.</li>
                  <li>Our databases are encrypted and scrambled so they essentially become useless in the very unlikely event that they are being stolen or inappropriately used.</li>
                </ul>If you wish for any of your information or records to be released to a third party, please let your counselor know. Your counselor will send you an authorization form that you will need to fill and sign before your information can be released.

                When you sign up we do not ask you for your full name or contact information. You may pick any "nick name" which will identify you in the system. When you decide to start the counseling process, we will ask you for emergency contact information which is kept safe in the system so it can be used if your counselor believes that you or someone else might be in danger.
